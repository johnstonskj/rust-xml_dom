/*!
This crate provides a trait-based implementation of the DOM with minimal changes to the style
and semantics defined in the Level 2 specification. The specific mapping from the IDL in the
specification is described [below](#idl-to-rust-mapping), however from a purely style point of
view the implementation has the following characteristics:

1. It maintains a reasonable separation between the node type traits and the tree implementation
   using opaque `NodeRef` reference types.
1. Where possible the names from IDL are used with minimal conversion; see mapping section below.
1. All IDL attributes become trait functions; see mapping section below.

This leads to a replication of the typical programmer experience where casting between the
node traits is required. This is supported by the [`xml_dom::level2::convert`](level2/convert/index.html)
module.


## Features

Currently only one feature, `quick_parser`, is provided which provides a new module `parser` with the
single public function. This feature is enabled by default.

``` rust,ignore
pub fn read_xml(xml: AsRef<str>) -> Result<RefNode>;
```

This will parse the document and return a new `RefNode` that corresponds to the `Document` trait.

# Example

```rust
use xml_dom::level2::*;
use xml_dom::level2::convert::*;

let implementation = get_implementation();
let mut document_node = implementation
    .create_document(Some("http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"), Some("html"), None)
    .unwrap();
println!("document 1: {:#?}", document_node);

let document = as_document_mut(&mut document_node).unwrap();
let mut root_node = document.document_element().unwrap();

let root = as_element_mut(&mut root_node).unwrap();
root.set_attribute("lang", "en");
let _head = root.append_child(document.create_element("head").unwrap());
let _body = root.append_child(document.create_element("body").unwrap());

let xml = document_node.to_string();
println!("document 2: {}", xml);
```

* **Level 4**: Not supported at this time.

# IDL to Rust Mapping

From the Level 2 documentation:

> The `Node` interface is the primary datatype for the entire Document Object Model. It represents
> a single node in the document tree. While all objects implementing the `Node` interface expose
> methods for dealing with children, not all objects implementing the `Node` interface may have
> children. For example, `Text` nodes may not have children, and adding children to such nodes
> results in a DOMException being raised.

> The attributes `nodeName`, `nodeValue` and `attributes` are included as a mechanism to get at
> node information without casting down to the specific derived interface. In cases where there is
> no obvious mapping of these attributes for a specific `nodeType` (e.g., `nodeValue` for an
> `Element` or `attributes` for a `Comment`), this returns `null`. Note that the specialized
> interfaces may contain additional and more convenient mechanisms to get and set the relevant
> information.

Wherever possible the documentation included in sections headed **Specification**  is taken from
the specification documents listed above.

## Interface Mapping

The actual concrete types used in the DOM tree are [`RefNode`](type.RefNode.html)
which in turn are references an opaque `NodeImpl struct. `RefNode` implements all of the DOM
specified, and extension, interfaces.

* The exception type `DOMException` and associated constants are represented by the enumeration
  `Error`.
* IDL Interface attributes are represented by functions;
  * readonly attributes simply have an `attribute_name` getter,
  * writeable attributes also have a `set_attribute_name` setter,
  * some attributes allow null in which case they have an `unset_attribute_name` setter.
* IDL function names are altered from `lowerCamelCase` to `snake_case`.
* IDL functions that are marked `raises(DOMException)` return [`Result`](level2/type.Result.html) with
  [`Error`](level2/enum.Error.html) as the error type.
* IDL attributes of type `T` that are described as "_may be `null`_", or IDL functions that "_may
  return `T` or `null`_" instead return `Option<T>`.

## Primitive Type Mapping

| IDL Type         | Rust Type      | Usage                                |
|------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| `boolean`        | `bool`         | all                                  |
| `DOMString`      | `String`       | all                                  |
| `unsigned short` | `Error`, `u16` | as representation of exception code  |
| `unsigned long`  | `usize`        | list/string indexes and lengths      |

# Logging

The DOM implementation makes use of the  [`log`](https://crates.io/crates/log) crate, although only
the `warn!` and `error!` macros are used to provide more information than the set of error
conditions defined by the DOM.
