/// DOM operations only raise exceptions in "exceptional" circumstances, i.e., when an operation is
/// impossible to perform (either for logical reasons, because data is lost, or because the
/// implementation has become unstable). In general, DOM methods return specific error values in
/// ordinary processing situation, such as out-of-bound errors when using `NodeList`.
